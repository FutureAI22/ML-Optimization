# 🚀 Machine Learning Model Optimization Techniques  

## 📌 Overview  

Welcome to the **Machine Learning Model Optimization Techniques** course! 🎯  

This is a **work-in-progress (WIP)** repository where I will explore **different machine learning models and their optimization techniques** through **Python notebooks and LinkedIn articles**.  

✅ **Hands-on learning** – Download and run the Jupyter notebooks.  
✅ **Practical examples** – Implement model tuning techniques.
